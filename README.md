# 🎬 Movie & TV Analytics SQL Project

This project explores trends in the movie and television industry using a dataset I personally collected and prepared. The analysis spans multiple areas including actor involvement, genre popularity, show viewership, and awards distribution — with a focus on structured querying, schema management, and relational insights.

## 📁 Project Overview

This individual school project was completed as part of my coursework at DePaul University. It showcases SQL logic applied to a custom entertainment dataset and highlights my ability to model and analyze complex relational data.

Topics covered include:
- Actor and movie participation patterns
- Relationships between shows and genres
- Viewer and platform activity trends
- Award tracking and show-level metrics

> ✅ The dataset was collected and structured independently for this project. All queries reflect original logic applied to a real-world themed domain.

## 🛠️ How to Use
- Download the SQL file: `movie-analytics-thuynguyen.sql`
- Open it in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio
- Run in a clean database environment
- The file contains:
  - Optional cleanup commands
  - Table creation and relationship definitions
  - Analytical queries and insights

> ⚠️ You’ll need to create the corresponding tables and insert data if you want to run this file outside of its original environment.

## ✨ Project Highlights
- Foreign key handling with proper ordering of constraint drops
- Actor → Role → Show → Genre relationships modeled and queried
- Multi-table joins and relationship-driven analysis across platforms, awards, genres, and viewer behavior
- Organized SQL code with clear section comments

## 📌 Motivation

As someone passionate about data and media, I created this dataset and project to explore the power of SQL in modeling and analyzing real-world relationships. It also served as a hands-on opportunity to reinforce my skills in query logic, schema design, and best practices in database development.
